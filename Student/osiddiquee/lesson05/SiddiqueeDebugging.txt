If you put an odd number for n, when you half n it will never become 2.
It will keep halving forever. As the n function, gets deeper into recursion.
The call stack gets much deeper and runs slower.


I also could not find the file for the exercise.

But i would theoretically, utilize n and s to dig into the function. I would
use b because I wouldn't select a large n.
