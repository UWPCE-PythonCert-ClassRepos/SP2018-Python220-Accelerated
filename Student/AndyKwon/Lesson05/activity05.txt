 def my_fun(n):
     if n == 2:
         return True
 
     return my_fun(n/2)

The code above is a recursion that, if the inputed value “n” is not a power of 2, then the program runs infinitely. The problem is that the function does not have a return false clause that is ever met. 

If n = 5, 
Goes to 2.5, 1.25, 0.625, etc.

To properly address the False clause, we can add something that immediately stops the recursion if not True...

Such as:

Def my_fun(n):
    if n < 2:
        return False
    if n == 2: 
        return True
    
    return my_fun(n/2)

This way, if n has passed 2, then we can stop the recursion and return False.
